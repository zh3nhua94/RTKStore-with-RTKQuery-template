# Redux Toolkit (RTK) Store and RTK Query Template

This is a basic template for setting up a Redux store using Redux Toolkit (RTK) and integrating RTK Query for API data fetching in a React application.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the required dependencies.

3. **Set Up Redux Store:**
   - Create a Redux store using Redux Toolkit (RTK). You can create reducers and actions using the `createSlice` utilities provided by RTK.
   - Export the store instance to use it in your application.

4. **Integrate RTK Query:**
   - Use RTK Query to fetch data from APIs. Define API endpoints and queries using the `createApi` and `createAsyncThunk` utilities provided by RTK Query.
   - Configure the API slice with a base URL and any other necessary settings.
   - Use the generated hooks (e.g., `useGetPostsQuery`) in your components to fetch data from the API.

5. **Set Up Components:**
   - Create React components to render UI elements.
   - Use Redux hooks such as `useSelector` and `useDispatch` to access the Redux store and dispatch actions.

6. **Start the Demo Server:** Run `npm run server` and then `npm run dev` to start the development server and view the application in your browser.
